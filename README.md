## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

This GitHub repo contains the lab materials for the [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://aka.ms/edx-dat263x-about) course on edX.

Start by following the [Setup Guide](DAT263x-Setup.pdf) to prepare your Azure environment and download the [labfiles](labs/DAT263x.zip) used in the lab exercises. Then complete the labs in the following order:
1. [Lab 1 - Getting Started with Azure Machine Learning](labs/DAT263x-Lab1.pdf). In this lab you'll use Azure Machine Learning Studio to explore some fundamental concepts of machine learning, on which most artificial intelligence is based.
2. [Lab 2 - Working with Text and Speech](labs/DAT263x-Lab2.pdf). In this lab, you'll learn how to analyze text and use Azure Cognitive Services to build AI solutions that apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
3. [Lab 3 - Working with Images and Video](labs/DAT263x-Lab3.pdf). In this lab you'll analyze images and build computer vision solutions using Azure Cognitive services.
4. [Lab 4 - Getting Started with Bots](labs/DAT263x-Lab4.pdf). In this lab you'll get started with Azure Bot Services, and build a simple conversational AI solution.
